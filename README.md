## The monorepo
This monorepo is an attempt to create a monorepo for a fake company and see how it works. I am trying to use pnpm and turbo.  I avoided nx.  I will add AWS, and Digital Ocean Soon, and perhaps start by publishing to github.  I also need to get a domain name and add a page.   Probably get an email list.
